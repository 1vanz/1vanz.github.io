## **Modelling Urban Road Network for Transport Planning**

------

***Graduation Thesis***

Advisor: Professor Yaohua Xiong

- Establish a set of specifications for the logicalization of road network topology, based on which road network models can be constructed and applied in the field of traffic planning.
  - Searched for various types of road junctions on a worldwide scale. Compared and contrasted them in geometry properties, and designed proper methods to define them with geometry elements
  - Referring to OpenDRIVE, designed transport facilities relevant to transport planning to match with the geometry structures
  - Coded the designed elements with Python



## **Key Technologies of Composite Water-retaining Asphalt**

------

- Research on modified mortar, a critical element of pavement material, to enhance the hydroscopicity of asphalt, intended to cool down the road surface and further mitigate the urban heat island effect. 

   - Based on good hydroscopicity and sustainable features, selected five types of supplementary material such as super absorbent polymer (SAP), and agricultural water-retaining agent. Designed 18 sets of check experiments of various supplementary material concentration

   - Designed concentration gradient experiments to gradually narrow the concentration gradient (from 5% to 0.5%) and obtained 526 specimens of mortar cube. Tested specimens’ mechanical properties, such as water-absorption and re-absorption, compressive strength, and rate of mass loss using high-precision dryer

   - Built a formula for relative hydroscopicity modification (RHM) based on Pavement Material Experimental Specification (JTG E20-2011) to value the modification effect

   - Analysed the test results on Matlab and Origin, which showed that SAP had the highest RHM in accordance with the previously built formula

   - Applied Orthogonal Experimental Design method for the optimal solution given by SAP, weighing the material scheme in three dimensions: RHM, cost and recycling rate (in and after use) to balance the performance, economy, as well as sustainability

- Awarded ‘Excellent Student Research Programme in SWJTU’ (top 5%)



## **Strength of T-section Beams based on Domestic UHPC**

------

- Data analysis for the flexural performance of the domestic UHPC T-section beams, which are the main type for medium and large bridges, and which have great prospects in the infrastructure construction.

   - Collected 200 sets of data in 40 beam-bending experiments and investigated the anti-bending behaviours of five different stiffness states of concrete at critical points of beam
   - Analysed data in Excel and Origin, and compared 25 simulated deflection curves with UHPC Domestic Specifications (GB T 31387-2015) to find the corresponding viable load at each point on different types of beams
   - Built a 3-D model in Revit to simulate the flexural performance of T-section beam of UHPC under typical loads to obtain the critical damping points
   - Found the optimal strength design schemes for five types of UHPC beams. Co-authored a 5000-word report



## **2020 ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition**

------

- Constructed a prototype canoe (6m*0.6m*0.37m) and displayed the information about the canoe’s design, materials chosen, and durability to withstand the rigors of a series of race demonstrations consisting of 200-meter slalom course etc.

  - Led 15 teammates for three rounds of canoes’ building, including concrete blending, canoe building

  - Designed five pairs of rib moulds with fixed dimensions (length: 72 cm, width: 15 cm, radius: Bezier curve), and kept modifying using Auto CAD and laser-cutting machines according to the design proposed by Structure Group

  - Designed the multi-layer construction of the canoe body, and according to the demand of stiffness, innovatively used two fibre meshes to reinforce the concrete between layers, which enabled the canoe to hold four 75kg individuals simultaneously

  - Selected the composite male mould to build the canoe, intended to increase the recycling rate to a peak of 65%. Innovatively applied silica gel to better enable demoulding.

  - Prepared design proposal relating to construction and project management. Collaborated with teammates to prepare the content around construction design, and participated in the presentation online due to the COVID-19 pandemic
